        <h1>My Favorite Type of Cookie.</h1>
        <article>
            <p>
                My favorite type of cookie is Chips Ahoy Chewy.<br> 
                I love the soft texture and the rich chocolate chips that melt in your mouth.<br> 
                It's the perfect treat for any time of day.<br>
                Whether I've had a long day or just need a little pick-me-up,<br> 
                Chips Ahoy Chewy always hits the spot.<br>
                Chocolate chip cookies are a classic favorite,<br>
                and Chips Ahoy Chewy takes it to the next level with its soft and chewy texture.<br>
                They're my guilty pleasure and I can't resist having a few whenever I see them.<br>
                And just recently, I discovered the Big Chips Ahoy,<br>
                it's like the regular Chips Ahoy but bigger and even more delicious!<br>
